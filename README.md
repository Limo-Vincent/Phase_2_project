# <h1 style="text-align: center;">Identifying Top Films Using Box Office Data

## Project Overview
Our company is exploring opportunities in the entertainment industry, specifically film production and distribution. To make data-informed decisions about which genres to invest in, this project analyzes movie datasets to uncover trends in audience preferences and genre performance.

The goal is to identify films that consistently perform well based on viewer ratings and popularity over time. By analyzing these trends, the project aims to guide strategic investment decisions in genre selection, helping reduce risk and increase the likelihood of success in the competitive film market.

## Business Understanding
As part of its diversification strategy, our company is expanding into the entertainment industry, with a focus on film production. To ensure a strong entry into this competitive market, the company must make data-driven decisions on which films to prioritize.

By analyzing historical movie data — including genre classifications, viewer ratings, and trends over time — this project aims to uncover patterns that highlight genres with consistent audience appeal. These insights will help guide the head of the company's new movie studio in selecting genres that align with market demand, reduce investment risk, and increase the likelihood of commercial success.
